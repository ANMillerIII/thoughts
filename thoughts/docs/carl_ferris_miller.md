<!-- ### Carl Ferris Miller -->

Infima is a styling framework that is designed for content-driven websites such as Facebook's open source websites. Many open source maintainers at Facebook are not front-end engineers nor designers, hence expecting them to come up with their own designs for their open source project websites will be additional work on top of the act of preparing their project for open sourcing and writing the necessary documentation. As a styling framework, Infima offers styles for different common user interfaces components - grid, buttons, forms, etc. It is ready to use out-of-the-box via a link tag in your website or power users can customize by selecting exactly what they need.
